Please note we are not responsible for if anything happens to your bot account. It is your responsibility to keep the  token away from anyone you don't trust. The bot uses discord.js to interact with the Discord API with your bot token. Do not share your .env file with anyone once filled out.

Please also note that Discord has a TOS for its API: https://discord.com/developers/docs/legal

This TOS is being updated August 15th, 2020 and will require all bots to have a privacy policy (even if it just says you don't collect personal information and has a way to contact you with any privacy concerns). You will need to add this yourself. 

More info can be found on the [Discord Developers](https://discord.gg/discord-developers) server in [this message](https://discord.com/channels/613425648685547541/697489244649816084/728031320625905794).

It is your responsibility to make sure your use of this bot is not against the TOS of any services it uses.
